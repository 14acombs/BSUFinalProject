# BSUFinalProject
Point and Click Barbie game designed for final project in 2014
This was a final project that I coded in Fall of 2014 at Ball State Univeristy for Computer Science and Intro to Python. The premise was to design an interactive game with objects, various soundbits, and images, including a map that was navigable.
